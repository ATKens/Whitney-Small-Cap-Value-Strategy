# Whitney Small Cap Value Strategy

## Overview

The Whitney Small Cap Value Strategy is an investment approach developed by Whitney George, renowned for his expertise in small cap stocks. Recognized as the "Best Fund Manager" by Financial Intelligence Monthly in January 2011, George's strategy focuses on identifying undervalued small cap stocks that offer substantial growth potential. This strategy emphasizes fundamental analysis to select stocks based on financial health and market valuation.

## Investment Philosophy

The strategy is built on the premise that small cap stocks, often overlooked by large investors, can provide superior returns. George's approach is meticulous, focusing on stocks that meet the following criteria:

- **Market Capitalization:** Below the average market cap across the market.
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Lower than the market average, indicating solid financial health.
- **Free Cash Flow Per Share:** Higher than the market average, suggesting efficient operation and profitability.
- **Return on Assets and Equity:** Higher than average, indicating effective management and profitable asset use.
- **Price-to-Earnings Ratio:** Below the market average, pointing to undervalued stocks.
- **Price-to-Book and Price-to-Sales Ratios:** Lower than the market average, further indicating undervaluation.

## How It Works

This strategy uses quantitative metrics to screen small cap stocks across various industries, excluding sectors like banking, non-bank financials, steel, mining, food & beverages, and communications due to historical underperformance.

## Usage

To apply this strategy, investors should focus on stocks that meet the specific financial criteria outlined, ensuring each stock is evaluated for its potential risk and return profile. The strategy is particularly suited for value investors seeking long-term capital appreciation.
